# Wind Energy Project
An ETL project utilising wind energy data - By Carly Wieland

# Project Outline / Scenario:
You are a data engineer for a New-Energies Company.
The company is exploring posible future wind energy oportunities in VIC and NSW, Australia.
This company wants to understand potential future outages, what could cause them, and what financial impact they would have. For this analysis, they will require data on a multitude of factors, including:

* expected energy outputs, 
* outage hisotoy in similar plants in the area,
* types of weather event in the area

You have been asked to create the dataset, and provide a comprehensive report of the ETL process, including:
* The sources of data that you extracted from (a minimum of 2 is required, and you must include how the data was formatted (CSV, JSON, pgAdmin 4, etc)).
* The type of transformation needed for this data (cleaning, joining, filtering, aggregating, etc).
* The type of final production database to load the data into (relational or non-relational).
* The final tables or collections that will be used in the production database (include reasoning as to why this database was chosen).


Once the report has been complete, you will need to upload the report to Github and submit a link to Bootcampspot.
